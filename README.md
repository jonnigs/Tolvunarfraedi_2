# Tölvunarfræði 2

Projects from the course Tölvunarfræði 2 (Computer science 2). The course used Java and C++.

### 3. Verkefni

1. Finnishin the Java class Fraction. Implementing Compairable for equals method and compareTo method.
2. Finnishing the Java class SinglyLinkedList.
3. C++ method reverse for the class SinglyLinkedList.

### 2. Verkefni

1. C++ method vector. Reads in numbers, the method collects them into a std::vector of double and then writes out the median and variance.
2. Finnishing the C++ class SinglyLinkedList. Added the method prepend that adds a node to the front of a list, Overoad for [] to get a node by number and a destructor for the class.
3. Finnishing the C++ class fraction. Overload for \* to allow mulitiplication of fractions, constructor for MixedFractions and overload for << to write out MixedFractions propperly.

### 1. Verkefni

1. C++ method swap. Takes in int pointers and swaps the values they point to.
2. Finnishing the C++ class fraction. Added cerr for denominator of 0, display method, plus method and reduce method.
3. C++ methods length & search. Length takes in a pointer to the first node in a singly linked list and returns the length of the list. Search takes in a pointer to the first node in a singly linked list and a integer, returns a pointer to the first node that contains the integer or the null pointer.

### 0. Verkefni

1. C++ method halloheimur. Classic Hello World.
2. C++ method v2. Reads in numbers from the user and returns the sum and average.

### Upprifjun

Review at the end of the semester.

1.  Java method reverseStack. Accepts a stack and returns a stack with the same components but in reversed order.
2.  Java method farthestM. Accepts a bag of 2D points and integer m. The method calculates the distances from the origin and returns the m greates distances.
3.  C++ method insertion. Insertion sort for std::vector of int.
